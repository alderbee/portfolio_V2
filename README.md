Hello! ðŸ‘‹  
This is my second portfolio website. My first one was built with Angular â€“ you can check that out here: [https://amitsv.com/](https://amitsv.com/)

This version is a personal portfolio site built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, and it's deployed live on **Netlify**.
